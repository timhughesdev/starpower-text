      Part of the art of choosing difficulties is to select those that are
      indeed just manageable. If the difficulties chosen are too easy, life is
      boring; if they are too hard, life is defeating. The
      <span class="star">trick </span>is to choose trouble for oneself in the
      direction of what one would like to become at a level of difficulty close
      to the edge of oneâ€™s competence. When one
      <span class="star"> achieves</span> this fine-tuning of his life,<span
        class="star"
      >
        he will know zest and joy and deep fulfillment.</span
